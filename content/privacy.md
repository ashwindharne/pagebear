# Privacy Policy
This privacy policy describes our policies on the collection, use, and disclosure of information about you in 
connection with your use of our services, including those offered through our websites, emails, and mobile applications
(collectively, the "service). 

When you use the service, you consent to our collection, use, and disclosure of information about you as described in
this privacy policy.

## Information We Collect and How We Use It
We may collect and store information about you in connection with your use of the service, including any information
you transmit to or through the service. We use that information to provide the service's functionality, fulfill your
requests, improve the service's quality, engage in research and analysis relating to the service, personalize your
experience, track usage of the service, provide feedback to third party businesses that are listed on the service,
display relevant advertising, market the service, provide customer support, message you, back up our systems, allow
for disaster recovery, enhance the security of the service, and comply with legal obligations. Even when we do not
retain such information, it still must be transmitted to our servers initially and stored long enough to process.

Please also note:

### Account Information

When you create a PageBear account, we store and use the information you provide during that process, such the first
and last name you enter, email address, and any other information you provide us as part of your account profile. We
also store and use any preferences you provide to personalize your experience. You can modify your account information
at any time through your account settings.

### Public Content
Your contributions to the service are intended for consumption by your followers and--in aggregate, de-identified
form--the public. These contributions include your ratings, notes, reviews, tags, profile, and lists.

### Contacts
You can invite others to join or become your friend on PageBear by providing us with their contact information, or by
allowing us to access contacts from your mobile device or third party sites to select which individuals you want to
invite. If you allow us to access your contacts, we do not retain any contact information after the invitation is
sent.

### Communications
When you sign up for an account or use certain features, you are opting to receive messages from other PageBear users
and PageBear itself. You can manage some of your messaging preferences through your app settings and device settings.

### Activity
We store information about your use of the service, such as your search activity, the pages you view, the date and
time of your visits.

## Third Parties
The service maylink to third party controlled websites, like a business' URL or via affiliate links. This privacy
policy does not apply to these third party websites, which are governed by their own privacy and data collection
practices. We do not share your personal information with these third parties.

## Data Retention and Account Termination
You can close your account by emailing us at [hello@pagebear.co](mailto:hello@pagebear.co), or through your account 
settings. We will remove your public posts from view and/or dissociate them from your account profile, but we may
retain information about you for the purposes authorized under this privacy policy unless prohibited by law. For
example, we may retain information to prevent, investigate, or identify possible wrongdoing in connection with the
service or to comply with legal obligations. We may also maintain residual copies of your information in our backup
systems.

## Security
We use various safeguards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we
receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or via mobile device, or method of electronic
storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal
information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Contact Information
If you have any questions or concerns regarding this privacy policy, please send us a detailed message to
[hello@pagebear.co](mailto:hello@pagebear.co), and we will try to resolve your concerns.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy
We may change this privacy policy from time to time. If we make significant changes in the way we treat your personal
information, or to the privacy policy, we will provide notice to you on the service or by some other means, such as
email. Please review the changes carefully. By continuing to access or use the service after those changes become
effective, you acknowledge the revised privacy policy.

## California Residents: Your California Privacy Rights
Under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 ("CCPA"), California residents have certain rights around PageBear's
collection, use, and sharing of their personal information. A more detailed description of the information PageBear
collects and how we use it is provided above in Section 1 (Information We Collect and How We Use It). Section 3 (Third
Parties) describes the categories of third parties with whom we share personal information, and what information may
be shared under different circumstances.

If you are a resident of California, you have the right to request to know what personal information has been collected
about you, and to access that information. You also have the right to request deletion of your personal information,
though exceptions under the CCPA may allow PageBear to retain and use certain personal information notwithstanding
your deletion request. You may send your request by email to [hello@pagebear.co](mailto:hello@pagebear.co). We will
not discriminate against you for exercising your rights under the CCPA. An agent may submit a request on your behalf,
but you must verify that your agent is authorized to do so.

Separate from the CCPA, California's Shine the Light law gives California residents the right to ask companies what
personal information they share with third parties for those third parties' direct marketing purposes. We do not
disclose your personal information to third parties for the purpose of directly marketing their goods or services to
you unless you request such disclosure. If you have any questions regarding this policy, or would like to change your
preferences, you may contact us at the address listed above in Section 8.

## Nevada Residents: Your Nevada Privacy Rights
Nevada Law (SB 220) requires website operators to provide a way for Nevada consumers to opt out of the sale of certain
information that the website operator may collect about them. PageBear does not sell your personal information to any
third party as defined in Nevada law, and will not do so in the future without providing you with notice and an
opportunity to opt-out of such sale as required by law. If you have any questions regarding our data privacy
practices, please contact us at [hello@pagebear.co](mailto:hello@pagebear.co).
